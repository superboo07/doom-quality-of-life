*DOOM Retro’s* console is a sophisticated command-line interface that displays system and player messages, as well as allowing the player to enter [console commands (CCMDs)](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro/wiki/CONSOLE-COMMANDS) and change [console variables (CVARs)](https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro/wiki/CONSOLE-VARIABLES). It may be accessed at any time by pressing the <kbd>~</kbd> key. When pressed, the console will appear from the top of the screen and extend downwards to cover half the player’s view, pausing any gameplay. CCMDs and CVARs may then be typed directly at the prompt.

While the console is open, there are a few controls that have special functions:
