*DOOM Retro* is the classic, refined *DOOM* source port for Windows PC. It represents how I like my *DOOM* to be today, in all its dark, gritty, unapologetically pixelated glory. Iâ€™ve strived to craft a set of features that uphold a certain level of attention to detail, and while still respecting that classic, nostalgic *DOOM* experience many of us hold dear.
